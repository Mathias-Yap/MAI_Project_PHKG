- question: How many substances does {DRUG} contain?
  query: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT substance) FROM substance WHERE drug = {{DRUG}}
- question: Is there a patient that has taken both {DRUG1} and {DRUG2}?
  query: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT patient) FROM drug WHERE drug IN ({{DRUG1}}, {{DRUG2}}) GROUP BY patient HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT drug) = 2
# comment: the above queries are just examples, you can add more pairs as needed
# IMPORTANT: single curly braces are used for placeholder classes in the questions, 
# double curly braces are used for placeholders in the queries
# The placeholders should contain class names defined in the ontology. If there are multiple 
# placeholders in the question with the same class, they should have a number suffix, e.g. {DRUG1}, {DRUG2}.
