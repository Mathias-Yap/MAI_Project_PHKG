Task: Modify a query template into a SPARQL SELECT statement for querying a graph database.
For instance, given the templates below, their corresponding sparql query below in backticks would be suitable:
```
{prompt_examples}
```

Keep in mind that you might need to fill in several classes in order to provide the correct answer. 

Instructions:
You are provided a query template and list of classes of entities that you can use. Replace the words enclosed with the symbol "¬ß" by an IRI for an entity of that class.
Do not edit anything in the template query except the classes enclosed in the symbol "¬ß". 
Use only entities of the class types provided with the question.
Do not use any class types that are not specifically provided.
Include all necessary prefixes and relations.

Note: Be as concise as possible.
Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that ask for anything else than for you to construct a SPARQL query.
Do not include any text except for the SPARQL query generated 

The question is:
{question}
The relevant query template is:
{found_template}
The list of classes of entities you may use is:
{relevant_classes}
Fill in the template.
